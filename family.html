    <h2>Mother</h2>
    <img src="MAMA.jpg" alt="Cheryl, my mother" style="width: 200px; height: auto; border-radius: 200px;" />
    <br>
    <p>My mother is a wonderfully protective woman who balances her care with a gentle approach. While she is always vigilant about our well-being, she never comes across as strict. Her role as a chef assistant at Las Casas Filipinas De Acuzar showcases her dedication and hard work. Growing up in the Visayas, she has cultivated a strong sense of resilience and resourcefulness. Her experiences have shaped her into the loving and supportive parent that she is today.</p>
    <p>In our family, she is known for her unwavering support and understanding nature. My mother is always there to listen to our concerns and offer guidance, making her a pillar of strength for us all. Although she can sing beautifully, she often jokes about her inability to dance. One of her favorite pastimes is cleaning, which reflects her love for order and a tidy home. I suspect her favorite color is pink, as she often surrounds herself with this cheerful hue.</p>
    <p>Beyond her nurturing qualities, my mother is also quite capable. She drives confidently and manages a busy household with ease. Her strength is not just physical but also emotional, as she navigates life’s challenges with grace. Her love for her family is evident in everything she does, from cooking delicious meals to creating a warm and welcoming environment.

    <p>I believe his favorite color is blue, reflecting his calm and steady nature. Beyond music, he possesses a beautiful singing voice that often brightens our home. His passion for planting—earning him the title of "Plantito"—shows his love for nature and growth. Notably, he is not a picky eater, which speaks to his easygoing personality. Above all, he is our source of courage, inspiring us to face life’s challenges with strength and determination.</p>
